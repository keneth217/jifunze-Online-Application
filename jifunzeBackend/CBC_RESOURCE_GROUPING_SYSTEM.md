- `strand` - Specific strand within learning area
- `subStrand` - Sub-strand within strand
- `competency` - Specific competency being addressed
- `grade` - Specific grade level

## Database Changes

### **Enhanced ResourceGroup Entity:**
- Added CBC-specific fields for proper curriculum alignment
- Updated education levels to match CBC structure
- Added comprehensive learning areas enum

### **New Repository Methods:**
- Filter by learning area
- Filter by strand and sub-strand
- Filter by grade and competency
- Advanced CBC filtering with multiple parameters

## API Endpoints for CBC System

### **CBC-Specific Resource Group Endpoints:**

#### **Learning Area Filtering:**
- `GET /resource-groups/learning-area/{learningArea}` - Get groups by learning area
- `GET /resource-groups/strand/{strand}` - Get groups by strand
- `GET /resource-groups/sub-strand/{subStrand}` - Get groups by sub-strand
- `GET /resource-groups/grade/{grade}` - Get groups by grade
- `GET /resource-groups/competency/{competency}` - Get groups by competency

#### **Advanced CBC Filtering:**
- `GET /resource-groups/cbc-filter?learningArea=X&educationLevel=Y&grade=Z` - Advanced CBC filtering

#### **CBC Metadata Endpoints:**
- `GET /resource-groups/strands/{learningArea}` - Get strands for a learning area
- `GET /resource-groups/sub-strands/{strand}` - Get sub-strands for a strand
- `GET /resource-groups/grades/{learningArea}` - Get grades for a learning area

### **Enhanced Existing Endpoints:**
- All existing endpoints now support CBC fields
- Create and update endpoints accept CBC-specific data

## Example Usage for CBC System

### **Create a CBC-Aligned Resource Group:**
```json
POST /resource-groups
{
  "name": "Mathematics Grade 4 - Numbers and Place Value",
  "description": "Complete mathematics resources for Grade 4 focusing on numbers and place value",
  "subject": "MATHEMATICS",
  "educationLevel": "UPPER_PRIMARY",
  "learningArea": "MATHEMATICS",
  "strand": "Numbers",
  "subStrand": "Place Value",
  "competency": "Demonstrate understanding of place value up to 10,000",
  "grade": "Grade 4",
  "groupPrice": 2500.00,
  "createdById": 1
}
```

### **Filter by CBC Learning Area:**
```
GET /resource-groups/learning-area/MATHEMATICS
```

### **Filter by Strand:**
```
GET /resource-groups/strand/Numbers
```

### **Advanced CBC Filtering:**
```
GET /resource-groups/cbc-filter?learningArea=MATHEMATICS&educationLevel=UPPER_PRIMARY&grade=Grade 4
```

### **Get Available Strands:**
```
GET /resource-groups/strands/MATHEMATICS
```

### **Get Available Sub-Strands:**
```
GET /resource-groups/sub-strands/Numbers
```

- **Senior Secondary Groups**: 3,000 - 5,000 KES

Pricing varies by learning area complexity and resource count.

## Next Steps for CBC Implementation

1. **Populate with CBC Content**: Create resource groups for all learning areas
2. **Add Strand Metadata**: Define standard strands for each learning area
3. **Competency Mapping**: Map resources to specific CBC competencies
4. **Grade-Specific Content**: Ensure content matches grade-level expectations
5. **Teacher Training**: Help teachers understand CBC resource organization
6. **Student Navigation**: Create intuitive browsing by CBC structure

The system is now fully aligned with Kenya's CBC curriculum and ready to support competency-based learning with proper resource organization by learning areas, strands, and competencies.
